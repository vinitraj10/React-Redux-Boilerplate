<p>I made this repository because at the start i found it really difficult to setup the webpack with my projects,since I am learning it right now so i thought to make a separate repository for it,so that it will be easier for me to memorize the steps which i have to keep in my mind while starting with webpack.</p><br/>
<p>webpack is a great bundling tool,A great alternative of gulp and grunt it helps us to keep our static files at one place we can write our static files anywhere and it mergers all the static files in one single minified file which is great in terms of memory and efficiency,though i am a begineer in this package manager and bundling concepts,but till now what i have read about them and what i have understood out of it i have written in this readme in a very concise way.</p><br/>

<p>So to start with webpack we need to follow these commands accordingly and then further we can intergrate with other frameworks like react-js etc.</p>
Intialize a json file :- 
<pre>npm init</pre>
Install webpack:- 
<pre>npm install --save webpack</pre>
Make webpack.config.js:-
<pre>touch webpack.config.js</pre>
Run webpack:-
<pre>webpack</pre>
